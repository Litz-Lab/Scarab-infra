# Scarab-infra
Dockerfiles of docker images running data center workloads and run Scarab simulation

## Docker setup
Install Docker based on the instructions from official [docker docs](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/).

## Requirements
To run scarab_ll non-public branches in a docker container, the host machine should have ssh private key ~/.ssh/id_rsa permitted to clone 'scarab_ll' github repository.
Only use this for images that are private and will always be! The private key will be visible in the container.

To run the SPEC2017 benchmarks, the host machine should have the image `cpu2017-1_0_5.iso` under `SPEC2017/`.

To access traces and simpoints already residing in UCSC LDAP (allbench_traces), you need a BSOE account.

## Build a Docker image and run a container of a built image

### By using a script
#### Usage
```
Usage: ./run.sh [ -h | --help ]
                [ -o | --outdir ]
                [ -b | --build]
                [ -t | --trace]
                [ -s | --scarab ]
                [ -e | --experiment ]
                [ -c | --cleanup]

!! Modify 'apps.list' and '<experiment_name>.json' to specify the apps to build and Scarab parameters before run !!
The entire process of simulating a data center workload is the following.
1) application setup by building a docker image (each directory represents an application group)
2) collect traces with different simpoint workflows for trace-based simulation; **this will turn off ASLR; the user needs to recover the ASLR setting afterwards manually by running on host**: `echo 2 | sudo tee /proc/sys/kernel/randomize_va_space`
3) run Scarab simulation in different modes
To perform the later step, the previous steps must be performed first, meaning all the necessary options should be set at the same time. However, you can only run earlier step(s) by unsetting the later steps for debugging purposes.
Options:
h     Print this Help.
o     Absolute path to the directory for scarab repo, pin, traces, simpoints, and simulation results. scarab and pin will be installed if they don't exist in the given path. The directory will be mounted as home directory of a container e.g) -o /soe/user/testbench_container_home
b     Build a docker image with application setup. 0: Run a container of existing docker image 1: Build cached image and run a container of the cached image, 2: Build a new image from the beginning and overwrite whatever image with the same name. e.g) -b 2
t     Collect traces with different SimPoint workflows. 0: Do not collect traces, 1: Collect traces based on SimPoint workflow - collect fingerprints, do simpoint clustering, trace, 2: Collect traces based on SimPoint post-processing workflow - trace, collect fingerprints, do simpoint clustering, 3: Only collect traces without simpoint clustering. e.g) -t 2
s     Scarab simulation mode. 0: No simulation 1: execution-driven simulation w/o SimPoint 2: trace-based simulation w/o SimPoint (-t should be 1 if no traces exist already in the container). 3: execution-driven simulation w/ SimPoint 4: trace-based simulation w/ SimPoint e.g) -s 4
e     Experiment name. e.g.) -e exp2
c     Clean up all the containers/volumes after run. 0: No clean up 2: Clean up e.g) -c 1
```
There are four ways to run Scarab: 1) execution-driven w/o SimPoint (-s 1) 2) trace-based w/o SimPoint (-s 2) 3) execution-driven w/ SimPoint (-s 3) 4) trace-based w/ SimPoint (-s 4). The execution-driven simulation runs the application binary directly without using traces while the trace-based simulation needs collected traces to run the application. SimPoints are used for fast-forwarding on the execution-driven run and for collecting traces/simulating on the trace-based run.
You need to provide the list of the applications you want to build images for them in 'apps.list' file, and the list of the Scarab parameters to generate parameter descriptor file in '<experiment_name>.json'. Please refer to the 'apps.list' and 'exp2.json' files for the examples.

1. Run a container to run Scarab simulations with already-collected traces with simpoints (Should have access to UCSC NFS)
#### Build the image where all the traces/simpoints are available and ready to run Scarab)
```
./run.sh -o /soe/$USER/allbench_home -b 2
```
#### Run Scarab simulations by using a descriptor file
First, modify <experiment>.json file to provide all the simulationscenarios to run Scarab
Run the following command with <experiment> name for -e.
```
./run.sh -o /soe/$USER/allbench_home -s 4 -e exp2
```

2. Run containers to set up applications for running/tracing/simulating
#### Build the image from the beginning and run the application with trace-base mode by collecting the traces without simpoint methodology. Copy the collected traces and the simulation results to host after the run.
```
./run.sh -o /soe/$USER/example_home -b 2 -s 0 -t 1 -s 2
```
### Step-by-step on an interactive attachment
#### Build an image
```
DOCKER_BUILDKIT=1 COMPOSE_DOCKER_CLI_BUILD=1 docker build . -f ./example/Dockerfile --no-cache -t example:latest
```
or
```
./run.sh -b 2 -o /home/$USER/example_home
```
or
```
export APPNAME="example"
export BUILD=2
source ./setup_apps.sh
./build_apps.sh
```

#### Check the built image
```
docker images
REPOSITORY                   TAG       IMAGE ID       CREATED        SIZE
example                      latest    1dd7a6097ef0   3 hours ago    6.66GB
```

#### Run a container of the image
'docker run' will stop the container after it runs the given command. Run with -v to create a volume and keep the updates inside the container remain. 'docker start' after the run will start the container again. You can run other commands inside the container by running 'docker exec'
```
export LOCAL_UID=$(id -u $USER)
export LOCAL_GID=$(id -g $USER)
export USER_ID=${LOCAL_UID:-9001}
export GROUP_ID=${LOCAL_GID:-9001}
docker run -e user_id=$USER_ID -e group_id=$GROUP_ID -e username=$USER -dit --privileged --name example_$USER --mount type=bind,source=/home/$USER/example_home example:latest /bin/bash
docker start example_$USER
docker exec --privileged example_$USER /bin/bash -c "/usr/local/bin/common_entrypoint.sh"
docker exec --user=$USER --workdir=/home/$USER --privileged example_$USER /bin/bash -c "cd /home/$USER/scarab/src && make"
```

#### Run simpoint workflow and collect traces on an existing container
```
./run.sh -o /home/$USER/example_home -b 0 -s 1 -t 1 -s 0
```

#### Run simulation with already collected simpoint traces on an existing container
```
./run.sh -o /home/$USER/example_home -b 0 -s 0 -t 0 -s 4
```

## Developers
When you add an application support of a docker image, please expand 'setup_apps.sh' script and 'run.sh' if needed so that the memtraces and Scarab results can be provided by running a single script. The rule of thumb is 1) to try to build a simple image where the basic essential packages are installed on a proper Ubuntu version (the first version of Dockerfile), 2) to run a container of the image, 3) to run the application, 4) to run the application with DynamoRIO (if 3) works), 5) to run Scarab with memtrace frontend feeding the collected traces from 4). 
If all 1) to 5) steps are working, you can add the processes you added after 1) to the Dockerfile and expand the script. Make sure that running the script provides the same environment and results as 1~5 steps.

## Notes
* DaCapo (cassandra, kafka, tomcat) - DynamoRIO, Scarab, and applications are successfully running, but DynamoRIO doesn't support jvm applications. memtraces cannot be collected. Only execution-driven simulation available.
* Renaissance (chirper, http)
* HHVM OSS (drupal7, mediawiki, wordpress) - Scarab complilation failed.
* SPEC2017 - only 502.gcc_r has been added. The SimPoint flow fixes the input size to `train` and the segment size to `100000000`.
* Verilator - setup based on https://github.com/efeslab/ispy-ripple. Clustering aborted due to out of memory.
